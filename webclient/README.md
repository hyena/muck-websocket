This is a sample demonstration client for use with the muck websocket proxy.

Instructions
============

Open `index.html` in your favorite browser while the proxy is running locally.

TODO
====

 * Handle reconnects and session management better.
 * Indication when the connection is lagging.
 * Improve general best practices of CSS, etc.
 * Nit: Visually differentiate linewraps within a line from those between lines.
